# Blockchain-Concepts
Blockchain is an immutable, sequential chain of records called blocks. Blocks can hold transactions, documents, files or any data you like, really, but the important thing is that blocks are chained together using hashes. The blockchain networks consists of interconnected nodes which update the blocks together using a consensus algorithm (like proof-of-work).
